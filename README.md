## About
This code was generated by [CodeCraftAI](https://codecraft.name)

**User requests:**
I want you to build me an app for buying premium NFTs. I want user to pay me 100 CRAFT (of course, user has to sign transaction). That transaction and user ownership of certain NFT should be stored somewhere. CRAFT is a Solana-based token btw. Once paid, user has to get access to that NFT in form of web, mail and image. For NFTs, generate some nice svg images.

## Project Plan
```
Okay, based on the requirements, here's a project plan for building the NFT marketplace, focusing on clarity and actionable steps.

**Project Title:** CRAFT NFT Marketplace

**Project Goal:** Develop a web application enabling users to purchase unique, programmatically generated SVG NFTs using CRAFT tokens on the Solana blockchain.

**Phases:**

1.  **Planning & Setup (1 Week)**
2.  **Backend Development (3 Weeks)**
3.  **Frontend Development (3 Weeks)**
4.  **Integration & Testing (2 Weeks)**
5.  **Deployment & Monitoring (1 Week)**

**Phase 1: Planning & Setup (1 Week)**

*   **Goal:** Define project scope, set up development environment, and establish communication channels.

*   **Tasks:**
    *   [ ] **Requirement Refinement:** Finalize detailed requirements and user stories based on initial request.  Clarify any ambiguities.
    *   [ ] **Technology Stack Selection:** Confirm specific libraries and tools for each component (e.g., specific Solana Python library, React component library, email service).
    *   [ ] **Environment Setup:**
        *   [ ] Set up Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, etc.).
        *   [ ] Configure development environments (local and staging).
        *   [ ] Install necessary dependencies (Python, Node.js, React, Solana libraries).
    *   [ ] **Database Design:** Design the database schema to store user information, NFT ownership, and transaction details.  Consider using a relational database (PostgreSQL) or a NoSQL database (MongoDB).
    *   [ ] **API Design:** Define the API endpoints for communication between the frontend and backend.
    *   [ ] **Project Management Tool Setup:**  Set up a project management tool (e.g., Jira, Trello, Asana) for task tracking and issue management.

*   **Technical Considerations:**
    *   Choose a suitable Solana library for Python (e.g., `solders`, `solana-py`).
    *   Select a database that aligns with the project's scalability and data consistency needs.
    *   Choose an API framework for Python (e.g., Flask, FastAPI).
    *   Choose a React component library (e.g., Material UI, Ant Design).

**Phase 2: Backend Development (3 Weeks)**

*   **Goal:** Develop the backend API endpoints for handling user authentication, Solana transactions, NFT generation, and data storage.

*   **Tasks:**
    *   [ ] **User Authentication:**
        *   [ ] Implement user registration and login functionality.
        *   [ ] Implement secure password storage (hashing).
    *   [ ] **Solana Integration:**
        *   [ ] Implement functionality to connect to the Solana blockchain.
        *   [ ] Implement functionality to initiate CRAFT token transactions.
        *   [ ] Implement transaction monitoring and verification.
        *   [ ] Implement wallet integration (consider using a wallet adapter).
    *   [ ] **NFT Generation:**
        *   [ ] Develop the NFT generation logic using Python and SVG libraries (e.g., `svgwrite`).
        *   [ ] Implement logic to generate unique NFTs.
    *   [ ] **Database Integration:**
        *   [ ] Implement data models for users, NFTs, and transactions.
        *   [ ] Implement API endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting data.
    *   [ ] **Email Integration:**
        *   [ ] Integrate with an email service (e.g., SendGrid, AWS SES) using a Python library.
        *   [ ] Implement functionality to send NFT images via email.
    *   [ ] **API Documentation:** Document all API endpoints using a tool like Swagger or OpenAPI.

*   **Technical Considerations:**
    *   Implement robust error handling and logging.
    *   Secure API endpoints with authentication and authorization.
    *   Optimize NFT generation for performance.
    *   Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse.
    *   Consider using asynchronous tasks for long-running operations (e.g., NFT generation, email sending).
    *   Implement proper error handling for failed Solana transactions and other potential issues.

**Phase 3: Frontend Development (3 Weeks)**

*   **Goal:** Develop the user interface using React, allowing users to purchase NFTs and manage their accounts.

*   **Tasks:**
    *   [ ] **UI Design:** Design the user interface based on the project requirements.
    *   [ ] **Component Development:**
        *   [ ] Develop React components for user authentication (login, registration).
        *   [ ] Develop a component for browsing available NFTs.
        *   [ ] Develop a component for purchasing NFTs using CRAFT tokens.
        *   [ ] Develop a component for viewing owned NFTs.
        *   [ ] Develop a component for displaying transaction history.
    *   [ ] **API Integration:** Integrate the React frontend with the backend API endpoints.
    *   [ ] **Wallet Integration:** Integrate with Solana wallets (e.g., Phantom, Solflare) using a wallet adapter.
    *   [ ] **State Management:** Implement state management using React Context or a state management library (e.g., Redux, Zustand).

*   **Technical Considerations:**
    *   Implement responsive design for different screen sizes.
    *   Optimize frontend performance for fast loading times.
    *   Implement proper error handling and user feedback.
    *   Use a consistent styling approach (e.g., CSS modules, Styled Components).
    *   Ensure accessibility (WCAG compliance).

**Phase 4: Integration & Testing (2 Weeks)**

*   **Goal:** Integrate the frontend and backend, and perform thorough testing to ensure the application functions correctly.

*   **Tasks:**
    *   [ ] **Integration Testing:** Test the integration between the frontend and backend API endpoints.

    *   [ ] **Database Setup:** Set up the production database.
    *   [ ] **Domain Configuration:** Configure the domain name to point to the application.
    *   [ ] **SSL Configuration:** Configure SSL certificates for secure communication.
    *   [ ] **Monitoring Setup:** Set up monitoring tools to track application performance, errors, and security events.
    *   [ ] **Logging Setup:** Configure logging to capture application logs for debugging and analysis.

*   **Technical Considerations:**
    *   Use a deployment pipeline for automated deployments.
    *   Configure backups for the database and application data.
    *   Implement security measures to protect the production environment.
    *   Monitor application performance and resource utilization.
    *   Set up alerts for critical events.
