**Here you can check all the code explanation.**

Okay, I understand. Now, please provide me with the following:

1.  **The original code output (first iteration) of the NFT marketplace project.** This should include all the files mentioned in the project structure.
2.  **The code review with suggested improvements.** This should include all the feedback you received on the original code.

Once you provide these two inputs, I will:

1.  Combine the information.
2.  Apply the suggested improvements to the original code.
3.  Generate a complete, functional code output.
4.  Provide a detailed explanation for each file and the improvements made.

I'm ready when you are!
